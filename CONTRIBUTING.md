## Contributing to fullpage.js

Your contributions to the project are very welcome. If you would like to fix a bug or propose a new feature, you can submit a Pull Request.

Please make sure you follow these points:

- Use the `dev` branch to commit your pull requests. 
- Do not edit files in `dist/` directory
- If the pull request is related with an issue, please name the issue number in the comments (eg: #16)
- Please prefer clarity over brevity in all cases (variable names, conditions, functions...)
- Describe the problem in the Pull Request description (of course you would do it, why do I mention that?)

Thank you for your commitment!
