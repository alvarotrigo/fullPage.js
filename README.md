It allows to create fullscren scrolling websites as well as adding some landscape sliders inside the sections of the site.

- [Living demo](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/)
- [Temporal Website] (http://alvarotrigo.com/blog/fullpage-jquery-plugin-for-fullscreen-scrolling-websites/)

## Introduction
The plugin is in its first version and will keep improving with the time.
Suggestion will be more than welcome, not only for requisites requests but also for coding improvements.

Let's make of this a great plugin to make the world easier!

Working under all modern browsers as well as old ones such as IE8, Opera 12...

## Usage
As you can see in the `example.html` file, you will need to include the javascript file `jquery.fullPage.js` and the css file `jquery.fullPage.css` 
of the plugin as well as [jQuery library](http://jquery.com/) (and the [jQuery UI library](http://jqueryui.com/) in case you want to use easing effects. (active by default))

###Including files:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.fullPage.css" />

<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>	
	
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.fullPage.js"></script>
```

###Required HTML structure
Each section will be defined with a `div` containing the `section` class.
The active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.
```html
<div class="section active"> WHATEVER</div>
<div class="section">WHATEVER</div>
<div class="section">WHATEVER</div>
<div class="section">WHATEVER</div>
```

In order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be difined with another `div`:
```html
<div class="section active">
	<div class="slide active"> Slide 1 </div>
	<div class="slide"> Slide 2 </div>
	<div class="slide"> Slide  </div>
	<div class="slide"> Slide 4 </div>
</div>
````
The class `active` will be requiered to specify which slide is the one to show in the first place.

You can see a full example of the HTML structure in the [`example.html` file](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/example.html).

###Initialization 
Then, you will only need to call the plugin inside `$(document).ready` function:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
	$.fn.fullpage();
});
```

## Options
- `verticalCentered`: (default `true`) Vertically centering of the content within sections.

- `resize`: (default `true`) Whether you want to resize the text when the window is resized. 

- `scrollingSpeed`: (default `700`) Speed in miliseconds for the scrolling transitions.

- `slidesColor`:(default `none`) Define the CSS `background-color` property for each section: 
Example: 
```javascript
$.fn.fullpage({
    slidesColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'],
});
```

- `easing`: (default `easeInQuart`) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical scrolling.
It requieres [jQuery UI library](http://jqueryui.com/) in case of using some of its transitions. Other library could be used instead.

- `menu`: (default 'false') A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the slides. This way 
the scrolling of the slides will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class `active`.
This won't generate a menu but just add the `active` class to the given element (the menu) with the corresponding anchor link.
In order to link the elements with the menu with the slides, an HTML 5 data-tag (`data-menuanchor`) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as 
used within the sections. Example:
```html
<ul id="myMenu">
    <li data-menuanchor="firstPage" class="active"><a href="#firstPage">First slide</a></li>
    <li data-menuanchor="secondPage" class=""><a href="#secondPage">Second slide</a></li>
    <li data-menuanchor="3rdPage" class=""><a href="#3rdPage">Third slide</a></li>
    <li data-menuanchor="4thpage" class=""><a href="#4thpage">Fourth slide</a></li>
</ul>
```
```javascript
$.fn.fullpage({
    anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', '3rdPage', '4thpage', 'lastPage'],
    menu: '#myMenu'
});
```

## Methods

### moveSlideUp
Scrolls one slide up:
```javascript
$.fn.fullpage.moveSlideUp();
```

### moveSlideDown
Scrolls one slide down:
```javascript
$.fn.fullpage.moveSlideDown();
```


### moveSlideTo
Scrolls the page to the given slide anchor name or to the given index.
```javascript
/*Scrolling to the section with the anchor link `firstSlide` */
$.fn.fullpage.moveToSlide('#firstSlide');
```

```javascript
/*Scrolling to the 3rd section in the site*/
$.fn.fullpage.moveToSlide(3); 
```
